# Studio App

The Studio app delivers the browser-based 3D avatar authoring environment. It will be built with React, Vite, and TypeScript, layering the shared `avatar-engine` rendering primitives with design system components. Early milestones focus on:

- Establishing layout scaffolding for viewport, timeline, and plugin panels.
- Integrating the collaboration SDK for shared sessions and presence.
- Providing hooks for AI-assisted workflows (pose suggestions, procedural generation).
- Instrumenting performance and error telemetry to feed observability dashboards.
