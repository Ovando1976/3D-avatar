## Product Vision
Build a creator-friendly, photorealistic real-time engine that empowers small teams to achieve cinema-quality interactive experiences faster than Unreal Engine. The roadmap below turns that vision into a staged execution plan.

## Strategic Pillars

### Rendering & Performance
- **Unified Rendering Pipeline** supporting forward+, deferred, ray-traced, and path-traced modes with hot-swappable lighting models.
- **Real-Time Global Illumination** delivering multi-bounce GI on current hardware with graceful degradation for previous-generation GPUs.
- **Virtualized Assets** through micro-polygon geometry streaming, sparse virtual textures, and on-device compression for cinematic fidelity.
- **Task Graph Scheduler** coordinating CPU/GPU workloads, data-oriented job systems, and deterministic simulation modes for esports and large-scale worlds.
- **Hardware-Aware Optimization** tooling to surface GPU/CPU bottlenecks, shader variants, and memory footprints during authoring.

### Content Creation & Collaboration
- **Procedural World Building** via node-graph workflows for terrain, foliage, weather, and parametric architecture with live previews.
- **Collaborative Editor** enabling multi-user sessions, asset-level permissions, presence indicators, and conflict resolution powered by operational transforms.
- **AI-Assisted Authoring** that translates natural language briefs into materials, animations, level blockouts, and cinematics with human-in-the-loop controls.
- **Interoperability Bridge** ensuring non-destructive round-tripping with Blender, Maya, Houdini, and Substance using USD and glTF pipelines.

### Simulation & Digital Humans
- **Modular Physics Stack** spanning rigid, soft, cloth, fluids, and destruction layers with unified constraints and deterministic options.
- **Performance Capture Suite** covering markerless facial/body capture, solver-based retargeting, and motion-blend libraries.
- **Crowd Behavior System** blending behavior trees, utility AI, and data-driven animation for large-scale intelligent agents.
- **Digital Human Pipeline** combining skin/muscle simulation, strand-based hair, and emotional state blending for lifelike characters.

### Connected Experiences
- **Seamless Cloud Deployment** with cloud-native build artifacts, autoscaling dedicated servers, and edge compute streaming.
- **Massive Multiplayer Networking** via an ECS-driven replication layer, zone/mesh partitioning, and stateless matchmaking.
- **Deterministic Replay & Rollback** instrumentation supporting esports broadcasting, QA automation, and collaborative playtesting.

### Workflow & Automation
- **Next-Gen Visual Scripting** that compiles graph logic into optimized native modules with hot-reload previews.
- **Plugin Marketplace** featuring vetted extensions, automated dependency validation, and revenue-sharing incentives.
- **Continuous Quality Lab** providing scenario playback, regression capture, distributed performance profiling, and ML-assisted optimization suggestions.
- **Unified Build Pipeline** targeting desktop, mobile, web, XR, and automotive with per-platform optimization presets and compliance gates.

### Open Ecosystem
- **Standards-First Integrations** with USD, OpenXR, OpenColorIO, Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal.
- **Transparent Governance** through public RFCs, telemetry opt-in analytics, and community steering councils.
- **Sustainable Licensing** tailored to indies, studios, and enterprise adopters with predictable cost structures.

## Milestone Plan

| Phase | Timeline | Primary Outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Foundations Alpha** | Months 0-6 | Rendering prototype (hybrid forward+/deferred), asset virtualization demo, ECS core, project structure & CI established. |
| **Creator Preview** | Months 6-12 | Collaborative editor MVP, AI-assisted material/animation workflows, physics + animation stack integration, cloud build pipeline beta. |
| **Connected Beta** | Months 12-18 | Massive multiplayer servers, deterministic replay, plugin marketplace launch, performance capture integration, developer analytics dashboards. |
| **Launch Candidate** | Months 18-24 | Path-traced renderer optimization, flagship demo shipping across desktop/XR, licensing program rollout, documentation & support readiness. |

## Engineering Foundations
- **Code Architecture**: Modular C++ core with Rust/TypeScript extension layers, ECS-first data layout, and strict ABI stability for plugins.
- **Build & CI/CD**: Bazel/CMake hybrid builds, hermetic toolchains, per-commit validation, nightly performance baselines, and package promotion gates.
- **Quality Strategy**: Unit/integration tests, golden scene regression suite, synthetic benchmarks, and telemetry-informed crash triage.
- **Security & Privacy**: Signed binaries, sandboxed scripting, secure asset storage, and GDPR-compliant data handling for collaborative features.

## Success Metrics
- **Creator Efficiency**: 2× faster prototype-to-playable compared to Unreal Engine (measured via partner studio pilots).
- **Visual Fidelity**: Match or exceed Unreal Engine's Lumen + Nanite sample scenes at 60 FPS on target hardware.
- **Collaboration Adoption**: 80% of closed beta teams using multi-user editing weekly with <2% merge conflicts.
- **Operational Scalability**: Sustain 10k concurrent players per shard with <100 ms latency and zero critical outages during beta.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Establish foundational rendering and asset management prototypes**
   - Deliver a micro-polygon renderer capable of real-time LOD adaptation on reference scenes and capture GPU frame captures to validate <11 ms budgets on desktop targets.
   - Stand up a streaming texture cache with residency visualization tools, stress-tested using photogrammetry assets exceeding 8K resolution.
   - Integrate asset metadata ingestion (USD manifests, variant sets) into the build pipeline so prototypes feed directly into the upcoming editor.
   - Success criteria: prototype scenes rendering at 60 FPS on RTX 4070-class hardware with <5% cache thrash rate in profiling captures.
2. **Build collaborative editor framework with plugin support**
   - Implement operational transform sync across viewport, hierarchy, and property panels with conflict-resolution telemetry.
   - Ship a role-based permission model (owner/editor/reviewer) with audit logs surfaced in the collaboration HUD.
   - Expose a plugin manifest API plus sandboxed scripting runtime and document the extension lifecycle.
   - Success criteria: three internal teams co-editing the same scene for >30 minutes without desync, and at least two prototype plugins (asset inspector, layout tool) built with the new API.
3. **Integrate AI-assisted workflows for content generation**
   - Launch a material authoring copilot that ingests text briefs, produces procedural graphs, and offers explainable parameter edits.
   - Add an animation blending copilot leveraging motion-matching datasets with guardrails for style-preserving interpolation.
   - Wire both copilots into editor undo/redo stacks and analytics so human-in-the-loop feedback improves model suggestions.
   - Success criteria: reduce material creation time by 40% in partner tests and achieve animator satisfaction scores >4/5 in usability studies.
4. **Launch closed beta with flagship demo projects**
   - Curate two hero experiences (cinematic narrative and multiplayer sandbox) that exercise desktop and XR deployment paths.
   - Automate performance telemetry dashboards across beta builds, focusing on frame pacing, memory, and network stability metrics.
   - Formalize support workflows: weekly triage, release notes, and feedback incorporation loops for beta studios.
   - Success criteria: sustain 95th percentile frame times <16 ms on desktop demo, <20 ms on XR hardware, and collect NPS ≥ 45 from beta participants.

## Prototype Code Implementations

The `src` directory now contains executable prototypes for the first wave of Immediate Next Steps:

- **Rendering** – `MicroPolygonRenderer` now supports cinematic-to-low presets, adaptive quality scaling, shading cost modelling, and detailed warning diagnostics for cache pressure.
- **Asset Management** – `StreamingTextureCache` adds configurable eviction policies, residency trend sampling, and pinning semantics while `MetadataIngestor` validates USD manifests and deduplicates variants.
- **Collaborative Editor** – `CollaborativeSession`, `OperationalTransformEngine`, and `PluginManager` implement OT-based sync, role-aware permissions, participant heartbeat pruning, and sandboxed plugin lifecycles with teardown hooks.
- **AI Workflows** – `MaterialCopilot` and `AnimationCopilot` expose configurable style libraries, deterministic seeding, diagnostics, and sample management for style-preserving results.
- **Closed Beta Telemetry** – `TelemetryDashboard` aggregates frame, memory, and network samples, computes outlier stats, and surfaces performance trends for beta program health.

Vitest suites under `tests/` validate the behavioral contracts for each module, ensuring the prototypes stay regression-free as the engine evolves.

This roadmap now links the high-level ambition to concrete milestones, engineering practices, and measurable outcomes that raise the bar beyond Unreal Engine.
