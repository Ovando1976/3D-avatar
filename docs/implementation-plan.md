# Implementation Plan to Surpass Blender

This document expands on the roadmap by describing the immediate actions required to execute on the differentiators. It captures the current repository audit, prioritised improvements, pilot feedback loops, and foundational investments.

## 1. Codebase Audit Summary

| Area | Current Observation | Gap vs. Roadmap | Suggested Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repository structure | Repo currently contains only `README.md` and sandbox configuration. No application source files or build tooling are present. | Missing baseline application implementing any creator workflows. | Establish project scaffolding (frontend, backend, infra) with modern tooling (e.g., Vite + React + Three.js/WebGPU, Node/Go services). |
| Onboarding & Guidance | No tutorial or UI assets in repo. | Roadmap calls for interactive tutorials and contextual tips. | Design UX flows and component architecture for tutorials; scope minimal guided walkthrough MVP. |
| AI-Assisted Creation | No ML models, API stubs, or integration points identified. | Needs AI mesh generation, pose libraries, automation tools. | Research accessible APIs (OpenAI, NVIDIA Omniverse) and design service boundaries for AI-powered features. |
| Collaboration | No networking layer, persistence, or real-time infra. | Requires multiplayer editing and version control. | Evaluate WebRTC/WebSocket architecture, choose database for change tracking (e.g., CRDT-based). |
| Cross-Platform Rendering | No rendering pipeline; no WebGPU or cloud compute setup. | Must deliver browser-first/WebGPU + cloud offload. | Prototype WebGPU renderer; assess serverless GPU workloads. |
| XR Workflows | No VR/AR integrations or assets. | Needs VR sculpting and AR preview pipelines. | Identify Unity/Unreal bridges or WebXR APIs to integrate. |
| Marketplace & Plugins | No marketplace backend, payment, or plugin interfaces. | Requires extensible commerce and plugin system. | Draft plugin API spec and evaluate commerce provider integrations. |
| Production Pipeline | No automation scripts or QA tooling. | Needs automated QA, render orchestration, analytics. | Create CI/CD plan, choose rendering tech (e.g., cloud GPU farm). |

**Audit Outcome:** We must bootstrap the core application before feature work. The roadmap will be used to define architecture requirements early so the foundation can support AI, collaboration, and extensibility.

## 2. Quick Win Backlog

| Priority | Initiative | Description | Owner | Dependencies | Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Guided onboarding tutorial | Ship a scene-based walkthrough explaining avatar import, pose, and export. | Product + UX | UI scaffolding, content authoring | 4 weeks |
| P0 | AI pose suggestions MVP | Integrate pose-generation API producing keyframe suggestions within editor. | AI team | API contract, renderer hooks | 6 weeks |
| P1 | Scene templates library | Pre-built lighting/camera setups for common avatar showcases. | Content | Asset pipeline | 5 weeks |
| P1 | Feedback capture widget | In-app prompt for user sentiment and feature requests. | Growth | Analytics stack | 3 weeks |
| P2 | Asset marketplace preview | Static catalog browsing to validate commerce UX before payments. | Platform | CMS integration | 8 weeks |

## 3. Pilot Creator Program

1. **Recruitment Criteria:** target VTubers, indie game studios, and virtual production teams that currently rely on Blender.
2. **Cohort Size & Duration:** 10 creators for a 6-week sprint aligned with quick win releases.
3. **Engagement Cadence:**
   - Weekly office hours for workflow coaching.
   - Bi-weekly usability tests focusing on tutorials and AI pose suggestions.
   - Shared feedback board with voting to prioritise pain points.
4. **Success Metrics:** tutorial completion rate, time-to-first-export, AI pose adoption, and qualitative satisfaction scores.
5. **Feedback Integration:** dedicate engineering/design triage every Friday to incorporate pilot insights into sprint planning.

## 4. Technical Foundations Roadmap

| Capability | Milestones | Tooling Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plugin architecture | Define extension points (import/export, UI panels, automation scripts); build sandboxed execution environment. | Use WebAssembly for client-side plugins; apply permission model and signing. |
| Cloud services | Implement account system, asset storage, job orchestration (rendering, baking). | Leverage managed Kubernetes or serverless GPUs (e.g., AWS EKS + GPU nodes). |
| WebGPU rendering | Evaluate Three.js + WebGPU renderer or Babylon.js; build abstraction to swap fallback WebGL. | Create performance benchmarks and cross-device compatibility matrix. |
| Data layer | Choose CRDT/OT-based collaboration engine with offline support. | Consider Automerge, Yjs, or custom CRDT service with Rust backend. |
| CI/CD & QA | Configure linting, testing, asset validation pipelines. | Use GitHub Actions + cloud-based GPU testing; integrate visual regression tests. |

## 5. Next Actions

1. **Create engineering proposal for project scaffolding.** Draft comprehensive blueprint covering application architecture, build tooling, and DevOps guardrails (see [`engineering-scaffolding-proposal.md`](engineering-scaffolding-proposal.md)). Secure sign-off from tech leads and align milestones with roadmap pillars.
2. **Staff cross-functional tiger team for P0 quick wins.** Assign dedicated leads across product, UX, AI, and rendering; publish RACI, sprint goals, and capacity plan to unblock guided tutorial and AI pose initiatives.
3. **Launch pilot creator recruitment pipeline.** Coordinate marketing outreach, application review rubric, and onboarding schedule; lock kickoff sessions with first 10 creators and establish NDA/comms workflows.
4. **Kick off technical spikes for plugin sandbox and WebGPU renderer.** Timebox experiments, define success criteria, and document findings to inform architecture decisions and de-risk foundational investments.

### Action Details

#### 5.1 Engineering Proposal for Project Scaffolding
- Owner: Platform engineering lead with support from DevOps and rendering SMEs.
- Deliverables: Target architecture diagrams, tech stack selection, repo structure guidelines, CI/CD plan, security/compliance checklist.
- Timeline: 2 weeks for proposal drafting, 1 week for review/approval.
- Success Metrics: Approval from architecture review board, sprint-ready backlog of scaffolding tasks.

#### 5.2 Cross-Functional Tiger Team
- Composition: Product manager, UX lead, AI engineer, rendering engineer, full-stack developer, QA lead.
- Responsibilities: Define KPIs for guided tutorial and AI pose MVPs, maintain integrated backlog, host twice-weekly standups, deliver demo every sprint.
- Dependencies: Hiring/contracting decisions, alignment with analytics & content teams.
- Risk Mitigation: Establish escalation path to exec sponsors; reserve buffer capacity for integration issues.

#### 5.3 Pilot Creator Recruitment Pipeline
- Funnel Steps: Targeted outreach (VTuber communities, indie dev forums), application form triage, interview/portfolio review, contract + NDA execution, onboarding webinar.
- Tooling: Use CRM (Airtable/HubSpot) for candidate tracking, Calendly for scheduling, shared Notion workspace for resources.
- Milestones: Confirm 20 qualified leads in week 1, finalize 10 accepted creators by week 2, kickoff sessions in week 3.
- Feedback Loop: Implement weekly survey, consolidated feedback report before each sprint planning session.

#### 5.4 Technical Spikes for Plugin Sandbox & WebGPU Renderer
- Scope: Prototype WebAssembly-based plugin sandbox with permission model; evaluate Three.js WebGPU renderer vs. Babylon.js; benchmark on target hardware matrix.
- Duration: Two 2-week spikes run in parallel with shared demo session at end.
- Outputs: Technical decision docs, proof-of-concept branches, list of follow-up backlog items with sizing.
- Risk Reduction: Identify security constraints for sandboxing early, document fallbacks for devices lacking WebGPU (e.g., WebGL2 path).

This implementation plan should be reviewed weekly to track progress and adjust priorities as we gather insights from pilots and foundational work.
