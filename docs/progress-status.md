# Production Readiness Progress Report

## Goal Alignment
Our long-term objective is to deliver a production-ready 3D avatar creation platform that outperforms Blender for collaborative, AI-assisted avatar workflows. This report summarises how close the current codebase is to that milestone and highlights the key gaps that remain.

## Current Implementation Snapshot
- **Studio web client** – The Vite-powered React app demonstrates core UX flows such as AI-guided pose prompts, collaborative session listings, and an avatar viewport driven by the shared engine package.【F:apps/studio/src/App.tsx†L1-L168】
- **Avatar engine & AI clients** – Shared packages expose placeholder Three.js viewport utilities and deterministic mock AI pose generation to let the UI render sample data without external services.【F:packages/avatar-engine/src/avatarViewport.tsx†L1-L160】【F:packages/ai-clients/src/index.ts†L1-L44】
- **Collaboration and automation services** – The API gateway wires stubbed REST and GraphQL endpoints to in-memory collaboration data, while the automation worker simulates render jobs backed by the same AI mock client.【F:apps/api-gateway/src/routes.ts†L1-L42】【F:apps/automation-worker/src/index.ts†L1-L30】
- **Monorepo tooling** – Workspace-level TypeScript configuration, package manifests, and a dev orchestrator script establish a cohesive local development story (pending successful dependency installs).【F:package.json†L1-L23】【F:tools/scripts/dev.mjs†L1-L72】

## Gap Analysis
- **Mocked integrations** – All AI, rendering, and collaboration features rely on deterministic mocks or in-memory state; there is no persistence layer, authentication, or real model inference, which limits production viability.【F:packages/ai-clients/src/index.ts†L1-L44】【F:packages/collaboration-sdk/src/index.ts†L1-L48】
- **Absence of build, test, and deployment automation** – There are no CI/CD workflows, automated tests, linting, or production deployment manifests wired into an executable pipeline, leaving quality and reliability risks unaddressed.【F:tools/github-actions/README.md†L1-L3】【F:infra/k8s/README.md†L1-L3】
- **Frontend polish and accessibility** – The studio app lacks routing, state management, asset pipelines, accessibility auditing, and performance optimisation necessary for production readiness.【F:apps/studio/src/App.tsx†L25-L168】
- **Scalability and security** – The API gateway currently operates in a single-process Express server with open CORS and no rate limiting, auth, or observability, making it unsuitable for production traffic.【F:apps/api-gateway/src/index.ts†L1-L27】
- **Operational monitoring** – Worker and service logs print to stdout without structured logging, tracing, or metrics, impeding troubleshooting at scale.【F:apps/automation-worker/src/index.ts†L1-L30】

## Path to Production
1. **Replace mocks with managed services** – Integrate real AI inference endpoints, persistent collaboration storage, and asset rendering backends, introducing configuration, retries, and error handling.
2. **Establish quality gates** – Add unit/integration tests, linting, type checking, and CI pipelines that gate merges; set up preview environments for the studio and gateway.
3. **Harden the platform** – Implement auth, role-based access, rate limiting, and observability across services; containerise and define infrastructure-as-code for staging and production clusters.
4. **Elevate the studio experience** – Build guided tutorials, multi-user editing, asset import/export, and accessibility compliance to surpass Blender in collaborative workflows.
5. **Pilot and iterate** – Onboard external creators to validate workflows, capture telemetry, and inform prioritisation for remaining feature depth.

## Readiness Assessment
Given the current scaffolding, the project sits at an early prototype stage. Core architectural boundaries exist, but essential production capabilities—real integrations, reliability tooling, security, and user-grade polish—remain outstanding. Delivering the path above is critical before claiming production readiness or competitive parity with Blender.
